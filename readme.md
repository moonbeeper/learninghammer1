# learning hammer

its simple, **its not a game**. this is my first attempt at learning how to use the hammer editor thanks to having the addon "godotvmf". this was made for Siege Week 5, but am not following the theme because i am too stoopid aadd its also the first time ive made a trimensional (3d) game which i did not enjoy making but i mean its the first time (excuses haha), probably the next time the experience will be better. i guess

## features

- physics objects
- hammer editor maps (use SourceSDK 2013 with Hammer++ and follow tutorial on [godotvmf](https://github.com/H2xDev/GodotVMF) repo)
- that's it, have a great day
