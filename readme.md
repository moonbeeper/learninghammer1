# learning hammer

its simple. this is my first attempt at learning how to use the hammer editor thanks to having the addon "godotvmf". this was made for Siege Week 5, but am not following the theme because its also the first time i've made a trimensional (3d) game which i did not enjoy making but i mean its the first time.
